1. This ephemeral attraction towards you haunts me with the phantoms of these “ifs.” ‘If only you were mine’ is but a delusional situation I dream of, for I am not worthy of you. I never was, and I probably never will be. 
2. You’re that pleasant half-remembered dream that echoes through my mind. A vague, yet beautiful memory of you that somehow makes me smile, even through the days that I feel alone.
3. You write poetry through the words that your lips could not articulate - poetry that you just can’t seem to conclude. Weep not, whisper to me your heart’s deepest regrets, and let me bear all the hurt you’ve felt.
